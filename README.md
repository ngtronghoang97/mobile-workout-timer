# mobile-workout-timer

This application will help users count down the time.
In several situations, this application is really helpful for the end user. For example, students can calculate their time to fit effective learning methods, such as "Pomodoro", "Time Blocking" and "Eat the Frog".
In the same way, gym goers can also count down their time between workouts and rest.

In the future, this app can be developed with multiple timers and be more flexible.

Thank you for reading and practising.
